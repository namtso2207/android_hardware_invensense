Android device integration example
----------------------------------

Here are some example files for integrating InvenSense Sensors HAL within an Android device.
The point here is to add all the permissions required for having a full Treble device working.

They have to be adapted for the device your are using (i2c and/or spi, selected chips, change in hw addresses).

There are 3 kind of files:
1. init.sensors.rc: init file for creating sensors data directory
2. ueventd.sensors.rc: add standard Linux permissions to the sysfs files
3. sepolicy/*: add all required SELinux policies

Changes required:
* ueventd.sensors.rc:
    - change the sysfs directories for matching your device i2c/spi sysfs path
    - keep only i2c and/or spi and the iio attributes depending on your chips (accel, gyro, mag, ...)
* sepolicy/genfs_contexts
    - change the sysfs directories for matching your device i2c/spi sysfs path
    - keep only the chips you effectly have on your device

Integration instructions:

1. init.sensors.rc needs to be copied inside /vendor/etc/init/ using the PRODUCT_COPY_FILES directive:
PRODUCT_COPY_FILES += \
    $(LOCAL_PATH)/init.sensors.rc:$(TARGET_COPY_OUT_VENDOR)/etc/init/init.sensors.rc

2. ueventd.sensors.rc content needs to be copy-pasted into your device ueventd.rc file. Installation
is done using the PRODUCT_COPY_FILES directive:
PRODUCT_COPY_FILES +=  \
    $(LOCAL_PATH)/ueventd.rc:$(TARGET_COPY_OUT_VENDOR)/ueventd.rc

3. sepolicy files needs to be integrated using the BOARD_SEPOLICY_DIRS directive
BOARD_SEPOLICY_DIRS += device/vendor/name/sensors/sepolicy
